Posted: Fri am Post subject: Hex editing a game, Reply with quote. i've been trying to hex edit the money in a game called YS Oath in. In the video, I show you how to use a hex editor to modify bytes in a game's sound files to Terraria: Funny, Unique, and Weird Cheats!

Use a hex editor like hxd and use the item hex codes from the terraria wiki. I've only ever edited the saves for Terraria mobile but I imagine it shouldn't be to different even if the save structure is different since all the hex codes will remain the same (assuming the Devs didn't completely rebuild it for the vita which I doubt). 2. level 2. Drag and drop  into the HxD window. Step 3 With HxD open, press Ctrl + F. Select "Hex-values". Type in " F0 44 80 ", and press enter. Step 4 You should now see three pairs of letters or numbers highlighted. Drag your mouse over the middle one that says "44". With the entire "44" selected, type "55" into your keyboard.  · You only need hex edit, a root, and of corse terraria.
